# TimeSeriesForecasting
In this repository we will forecast time, through ARIMA and SARIMAX initially and  will upload some complex projects as well on VAR (Vector Auto Regression) VECM (Vector Error Correction Models) ARDL (Auto Regressive Distributed Lag Models) Recurrent Neural Networks (FFTT or RTNN)

In this project "SalesForecasting", we have forecast sales of different warehouses through ARIMA and Seasonal Arima model. The forecasted sales is of 9 months. There are some screenshots as well which clarifies how well we forcasted the sell.
